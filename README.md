# Unity Assets Bundle Extractor
Unity .assets and AssetBundle editor

UABE is an editor for Unity 4/5 .assets and AssetBundle files.
It uses type information extracted from Unity to create and to import asset dumps.
There are multiple plugins to convert Unity assets from/to common file formats :
- The Texture plugin can export and import .png and .tga files.
- The TextAsset plugin can export and import .txt files.
- The AudioClip plugin can export uncompressed .wav files from U5's AudioClip assets using FMOD.
- The Mesh plugin can export .obj files.
- The MovieTexture can export and import .ogv (Ogg Theora) files.
