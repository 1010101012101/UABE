# Unity Assets Bundle Extractor
Unity .assets and AssetBundle editor

UABE is an editor for Unity 3.4+/4/5/2017 .assets and AssetBundle files. It can create standalone mod installers from changes to .assets and/or bundles.
Type information extracted from Unity is used to create and to import asset dumps.
There are multiple plugins to convert Unity assets from/to common file formats :
- The Texture plugin can export and import .png and .tga files.
- The TextAsset plugin can export and import .txt files.
- The AudioClip plugin can export uncompressed .wav files from U5's AudioClip assets using FMOD, .m4a files from WebGL builds and Unity 4 sound files.
- The Mesh plugin can export .obj files.
- The MovieTexture plugin can export and import .ogv (Ogg Theora) files.
- The TerrainData plugin can export and import .raw files readable by Unity.
